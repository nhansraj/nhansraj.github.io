#<b> Welcome to the Michael E. DeBakey V.A. Medical Center Vascular Surgery Service!</b)
Vascular surgery is an exciting, rapidly-evolving specialty. We operate with open surgical and percutaneous/endovascular techniques in virtually all areas of the body for a wide range of pathologies. Since this will only be a two-week rotation, focus on fundamental concepts, including: how to identify and quantify lower extremity peripheral arterial disease (PAD); indications for carotid artery interventions; means of achieving permanent dialysis access in patients with end-stage renal disease; and identifying foot infections. 
Pre-rotation:
CPRS access: strongly recommend this to be more actively involved in patient care. Can obtain this via Carol Young (Carol.Young2@va.gov). I am your faculty contact for any issues.
Over view of Rotation:
1.	Morning Rounds: Start at 6am. NO prerounds. There are table rounds at 745 AM on Monday and Thursday. Plan to meet the senior fellow on your first day of the rotation (using the contact information provided on the email from the Surgery Education Office). Call 26800(OR) or Vascular Surgery Resident room (26171) day before to arrange this.
2.	OR Cases begin by 0730am on Monday, Tuesday, Thursday and Friday, 0830 on Wednesdays.
3.	Wear the two-piece lead aprons and a thyroid shield for any case involving fluoroscopic imaging. These provide excellent protection and are superior to the one-piece lead aprons that leave you exposed if you turn away from the radiation source
4.	Clinics: In Person clinic is Thursday. You should use this opportunity to pair up with a senior trainee and present your H&P and doppler exam.
5.	Didactics: We are aware of your seminars on Wednesday mornings. Ensure you also attend any chairman rounds that Dr. Rosengart plans during your rotation. 
6.	Pager: If it is a ten-digit pager number, dial the number. After you here the tone, dial in your call back number, then press "#". If it is a four-digit pager number, dial "*5", then the four-digit number. Dial in your call back number after the tone and wait for the confirmation tone or message.
Enhancing your experience:
1.	Main advice: To enhance your experience participate actively and take initiative. Ask questions. Request up to 2 inpatients you can follow closely; read about their pathology and management, write notes, and be involved in formulating the plan of care. Try to see consults with the on-call resident. Know the OR schedule in advance, and familiarize yourself with the details of the case -- their initial presentation and indication for the operation, basics about the procedure, relevant anatomy, and post-operative complications that may occur. Don't just stand around in the OR either -- be involved in positioning, have someone teach you how to place a Foley catheter, help retract / cut sutures, ask about closing skin incisions, etc. 
2.	Follow 2 patients- preferably those that you saw preop and operated on. Round on them with the senior and present on Mon/Thurs.
3.	Notes: Write progress notes (student progress note or H&P). They are supplemental but not replacement of the resident note. The surgery education office has confirmed that a Doppler exam of the lower extremities suffices for the observed H&P requirement for this two-week subspecialty rotation. So, make sure an attending watches you do this doppler exam.
4.	During the day: You should also spend additional time in the afternoon following up on your patients, reviewing labs. Ask the residents to call you when they get a consult so you. Can participate.
5.	Much of the evaluation we are asked to complete at the end of your rotation focuses on your ability to elicit a surgical history, perform and interpret physical exam findings, give verbal presentations, write clear notes, and communicate effectively, so being involved in this on a daily basis will give us plenty of opportunities for feedback and evaluation. Outstanding students know all the details of the patients they follow closely. 
6.	Technical Skills: Make a plan to get experience with suturing, knot typing, skin closure and with Foley catheter placement. Practice knot typing and suturing outside the OR. There will be a session usually in the first week of your rotation otherwise reach out to be to go over. Outstanding students will often work with the fellows or faculty to identify educational or technical objectives before every case.
7.	Feedback: provide midpoint feedback in the first week with a staff you have spent most time with Mon-Wed.
8.	Reading: “NMS Surgery” by Jarrell and Carabasi (the outline-format textbook, NOT the NMS Case Files) are good texts. Attached is a reference book for your reading (link below). The two-volume “Essentials of General Surgery” & “Essentials of Surgical Specialties” books by Peter F. Lawrence are also good. “Surgical Recall” contains a lot of trivia that is NOT helpful in learning fundamental concepts.
9.	Other reading material: Attached are some reading material  on PAD, carotid disease and aortic disease. (https://github.com/nealbarshes/nealbarshes.github.io/blob/main/MedicalStudents/index.md)

Good luck on your rotation! Feel free to reach out to me with any questions or concerns.
